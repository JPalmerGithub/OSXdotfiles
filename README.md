My OSX Dotfiles

Most/All of these files have been built using the many and varied verisions I've found arround both the web and here on github. I thank the original posters for providing me code for inspiration/aspitation and outright theft

.bash_profile is my main opener
.bashrc refers any call to it to go to .bash_profile
.bash_prompt is grabed in its entirity from anothers dotfiles git

All of the .git* files have been pulled from others

.functions is a compiliation of the many functions files I've found on Web and Git

.SuperBrew2 Is a Script that uses Homebrew to Install Update and Clean Up Appliations.

Please use at your own risk, It works on OSX 10.8.5 at least so far. Hoping to test on 10.9 soon.

I've tried to Document as much as I could so the script should be self explanatory. Also note
I have plagurized some of the script out of several other persons that have written brew scripts on Git,
but cannot note them here (specifically the Keg Function).

Thanks,
