My OSX Dotfiles

.SupwrBrew2 Is a Script that uses Homebrew to Install Update and Clean Up Appliations. 
Please use at your own risk, It works on OSX 10.8.5 at least so far. Hoping to test on 10.9 soon.

I've tried to Document as much as I could so the script should be self explanatory. Also note
I have plagurized some of the script out of several other persons that have written brew scripts on Git,
but cannot note them here (specifically the Keg Function).

Thanks,
Bob
