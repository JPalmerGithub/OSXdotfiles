My OSX Dotfiles

Most/All of these files have been built using the many and varied verisions I've found arround both the web and here on github. I thank the original posters for providing me code for inspiration/aspitation and outright theft.

.bash_profile is my main opener
.bashrc refers any call to it to go to .bash_profile
.bash_prompt is calling LiquidPrompt (on git https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt)
.bash_profile sources the following files on execution:
      path,bash_prompt,exports,aliases,functions,extra

All of the .git* files have been pulled from others

.functions is a compiliation of the many functions files I've found on Web and Git

.superBrew.sh Is a Script that uses Homebrew to Install Update and Clean Up Appliations.

Please use at your own risk, It works on OSX 10.10 and "seems" to work on 10.11 at least so far.

I've tried to Document as much as I could so the scripts should be self explanatory. Also note
I have plagurized some of the script out of several other persons that have written brew scripts on Git,
but cannot note them here (Just too many people, too long a time connecting code snippets).

Thanks,
